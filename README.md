Assignment 2 Submission There was an error with the initial assignment 2 submission process, which necessitated creating a new submission form. Please submit your assignment 2 solutions here. The assignment 2 text is copied below for clarity:

Assignment 2 is to work with a partner to implement a fixed-time step, variable rendering game loop. Feel free to extend the game loop with the bouncing ball that we have used in class, or make your own!

This project is a partner assignment. You may have 1 (and only 1) partner. If you both are having trouble with this assignment, come talk to me earlier rather than later. You can both submit the same code for this assignment. However, in addition to grading your code, I, the TA, or the course grader will have a brief conversation with both of you individually so that we can verify you both understand how the code is working and that you each contributed to the project. The grading breakdown is:

10 points: code works 5 points: correct explanation to me of how the code works 5 bonus points: complete some or all of the extra credit listed below Some resources:

Full credit (15 points) will be awarded for a deterministic game loop that functions regardless of frame rate that you can explain to me/TA/course grader. However, up to 5 points of extra credit will be awarded for additional effort and creativity, including:

Add in interpolated rendering (the second link gives a tutorial on how to do this) Use webworkers (or some other scheduling pattern) to further improve efficiency (the second link gives a webworkers tutorial) Do something more interesting than a bouncing controllable ball! The assignment will be due by midnight on Tuesday, 9/20.

To submit, upload your code to in response to this assignment page. If your code contains additional resources other than the jquery.hotkeys.js and key_status.js scripts, submit your entire project as a zipped folder containing your html code and all resources.
